You've picked your character and you're ready to begin your adventure in Paralake! There's a few places you'll need to go before you start trying to make all that money, which don't worry, will come soon! Quick note: Press F1 on your keyboard to view the interaction menu, here you can view rules, skills and other juicy info.</p>\r\n                <p>Here's a map of Paralake, I'll explain where to go below.</p>\r\n                <Map src={intromap} />\r\n                <p>You'll firstly want to make your way to either of the yellow dots, quick tip: holding ALT will let you sprint. The yellow dot straight ahead down 'Shady Street' is closest. These are gas stations in which you can buy a cellphone, water and a flashlight. These are 3 good items to have, water is optional but it increases your health and is definitely recommended. I personally always carry a flashlight and it goes without saying that you will need a phone. When you spawn in you should have enough money to purchase these items, if for some reason you do not then you can go to either of the ATMs marked in green on the map and withdraw whatever money you need.</p>\r\n                <p>To check how much money you have on you, hold Q which will open your inventory, which should currently contain nothing. You shouldn't carry lots of money around with you at most given times as you could be mugged and lose it all.</p>\r\n                <p>At most given times; or when there isn't a mayor, a cellphone will cost you $625 (25% tax) however this price varies depending on taxes, which we'll go into later. You can also buy a water bottle for $187.5 and a flashlight for $1,000, once again, this is prone to change along with taxes.</p>\r\n                <p>You next want to make your way to the orange dot, that is a Fredy's bakery and is only a short walk from City Hall (spawn). In here you can buy Burgers which are the best valued and probably best source of food. At any given time you can carry 15 food/water, so you'll want to moderate. I would recommend 10-12 burgers then 3-5 water.</p>\r\n                <p>When you've stocked up on food, bought a smartphone and possibly a flashlight, you can press Z to open up your phone and do all kinds of cool things. If you hold Q again, you will see your food and phone (and water if you bought any) in your inventory. To consume food or water, click on it while holding Q.</p>\r\n                <p>You're now ready to move on!</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n        )\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default SectionOne;","const sections = {\r\n    \"section1\": {\r\n        \"title\": \"introduction\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"section2\": {\r\n        \"title\": \"statistics\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"section3\": {\r\n        \"title\": \"detailed map\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"section4\": {\r\n        \"title\": \"making money\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"section5\": {\r\n        \"title\": \"vehicles\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"section6\": {\r\n        \"title\": \"the mayor & taxes\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"section7\": {\r\n        \"title\": \"crafting & basic combat\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"section8\": {\r\n        \"title\": \"locations of interest\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"section9\": {\r\n        \"title\": \"finish\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"section10\": {\r\n        \"title\": \"reference\"\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport { sections };","import React from 'react';\r\nimport { sections } from '../variables';\r\n\r\nclass Section extends React.Component {\r\n    render() {\r\n        return (\r\n            <div id={`section${this.props.num}`}>\r\n                <h5 className=\"heading\">SECTION {this.props.num} - {sections[\"section\" + this.props.num].title} <a className=\"jumpAnchor\" id={`jumpAnchor${this.props.num}`} href={\"#section\" + this.props.num}>#</a></h5>\r\n            </div >\r\n        );\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass Heading extends React.Component {\r\n    render() {\r\n        return (\r\n            <div id={`${this.props.else}`}>\r\n                <h5 className=\"heading\">{this.props.title} <a className=\"jumpAnchor\" id={`jumpAnchor${this.props.else}`} href={\"#\" + this.props.else}>#</a></h5>\r\n            </div>\r\n        );\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport { Heading, Section }","import React from 'react';\r\nimport { Heading } from '../titles';\r\n\r\nclass SectionTwo extends React.Component {\r\n    render() {\r\n        return (\r\n            <div>\r\n                <p>The next important thing, your statistics.

I can think of two that shine above anything else, City Jobs and selling weapons you've crafted (which isn't relevent currently). Another perfectly viable source of income is fishing at hicktown but I won't go over that here as there are lots of great guides for that which I will link below.</p>\r\n                <Heading title=\"jobs\" else=\"jobs\" />\r\n                <p>These are the current legal jobs. Take a look through all of them! Take a look at <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href={jobmap}>this map</a> to see where all the job NPC's are located.</p>\r\n                <JobCarousel />\r\n\r\n                <p style={{ paddingTop: '15px' }}>Jobs flagged with a <Required>*</Required> require you to apply for the position in-game. This is just a set of questions asked by the NPC. All the answers can be found in section 4 of the <a href=\"https://perpheads.com/rules.html\">Server Rules</a>. If you fail an application you simply have to wait 30 minutes and you can retake it.</p>\r\n                <p>Every 5 minutes you receive a paycheck, the pay varies between jobs and is prone to change with income tax. Income tax simply takes a percentage off your paycheck and the amount your paid is controlled by the Mayor.</p>\r\n                <p>That concludes the legal way to make money, simple I know! Onto the juice part.</p>\r\n\r\n                <Heading title=\"the illegal way\" else=\"illegalmoney\" />\r\n                <p>I would recommend, even if you haven't spent any of your banked starter money, you spend some time as a Paramedic. You will make good money and quickly witness lots of the map which is always a great thing. Once you're confident you know the general locations of the map; bazaar etc, you can get started. </p>\r\n                <p>I'm only going to teach you how to grow weed today, there are lots of amazing guides on how to produce the other narcotics so I'll leave it to them to teach you. Weed is the easiest and cheapest to produce and can get you a very pretty profit if you do it right. </p>\r\n                <p>Before doing any of this, you need to get your crafting level up a little bit. Go to Uncle Cos' opposite bank and buy 2 chunks of plastic and 1 piece of metal, then press F1->mixtures->melee and craft a baseball bat. Do this until your crafting is at least level 4. In doing this you will also level up your firearms a bit, which comes in later.</p>\r\n                <p>You firstly want to head down to bank, refer to the <a href=\"#section3\">detailed map</a> if you've forgotten where the bank is. When you're inside the bank, speak to one of the NPC's. Crouch if they're hard to get to or jump over the counter. When you're in the interaction menu, purchase either an appartment or a bazaar shop. For the first time I would recommend a bazaar shop as it's cheaper and you can do other things out front when you grow which makes it less obvious you're growing. The only negatives to a shop is that they are easy to raid and you can only make weed inside them.</p>\r\n                <p>There's then two options for how you grow the weed; planter box or basic planter. The basic planter is much cheaper to craft but makes less profit and is more expensive to maintain. The planter box is slightly more technical and is harder to setup but is much more worth it in the end and produces much more profit.</p>\r\n                <p>Next, go to Uncle Cos' next to bank to buy supplies. For both of the recipes, you need to buy a work bench from the NPC on the right. If you want to use a basic planter, buy the following:</p>\r\n                <ul>\r\n                    <li>5 gardening pots from the NPC on the right</li>\r\n                    <li>4 wooden boards from the NPC on the left</li>\r\n                    <li>3 glue from the NPC on the left</li>\r\n                    <li>3 wood nails from the NPC on the left</li>\r\n                </ul>\r\n                <p>At 25% sales tax (default), this will cost you $4718. If you want to make a planter box (recommended), buy the following:</p>\r\n                <ul>\r\n                    <li>7 pieces of metal from the NPC on the left</li>\r\n                    <li>11 chunks of plastic from the NPC on the left</li>\r\n                    <li>2 glue from the NPC on the left</li>\r\n                    <li>3 hunks of polymer from the same NPC</li>\r\n                    <li>6 gardening pots</li>\r\n                </ul>\r\n                <p>This will cost $5625 at default tax. To set up the planter box, you will also need to buy the following:</p>\r\n                <ul>\r\n                    <li>3 metal rods, 1 glue, 3 pieces of metal and 2 chunks of plastic from Uncle Cos'</li>\r\n                    <li>3 light bulbs from RagnaTech, which is just up the road from Bazaar.</li>\r\n                </ul>\r\n                <p>With these extra materials, that cost $3843, you can craft a radiator and a light pole. Two crucial parts of the planter box. Next head to the fish shop opposite the bank and buy two water tanks. Once you've bought the tanks, head to the City Garage next to bank and run to the pond behind it. When you're submerged in the pond, click on the water tanks in your inventory and it will fill them. You can also fill them in the Hicktown lake.</p>\r\n                <Heading title=\"where to find the drug dealer\" else=\"dd\" />\r\n                <p>Next, you will need to find the drug dealer. The dealers' location changes every few hours so it may take some searching. The monorail is your best friend and it can get you to any of the sectors very fast, make good use of it. Once you have sold 1000 bags of weed, the dealer texts you when their location changes. To find the drug dealer, refer to <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href={ddmap}>this map</a> that I made.</p>\r\n                <p>Once you have located the dealer, you want to ask them if they are selling, they will say \"what do you want?\" and you want to pick something along the lines of \"weed, green\" etc. Multiple names for it but you want to select weed and if you're using a basic planter, buy 5 seeds, if you're using a planter box, buy 6 seeds.</p>\r\n                <p>When you have your seeds and all your crafting materials you want to make your way to the property you bought. When you are there, go inside and store the seeds for later use. Click on your work bench in the inventory and go to one of the walls, if you can place it there; there will be a green outline of it. Left click and you have placed the work bench. If you have a bazaar shop, I recommend placing it in the front.</p>\r\n                <Heading title=\"basic crafting & production\" else=\"production\" />\r\n                <p>Next, look at the work bench and press F1. Go to the \"mixtures\" tab and in that tab, go to the \"drugs\" tab. Here you will see the recipes for the planter boxes. Left click on the icon of the box you want to craft, which should be flashing green. This will begin the crafting sequence and soon enough you should have a freshly crafted planter box. Click E on your workbench to view storage and left click on it to take it out.</p>\r\n                <p>This part only applies for people who chose the planter box; go back to mixtures and select furniture, then craft a radiator and a light pole.</p>\r\n                <p>Once you've crafted your planter box/basic planter, go into the back of your store and place it by pressing left click on it in the inventory. To setup a basic planter: get your seeds and whilst looking at your placed planter, press left click on the seeds. This will plant them 1 buy 1. If you want to move the planter at any time, press right click on it with your fists out. To check on your plant progress press E on the planter.</p>\r\n                <p>Setting up the planter box is only slightly more complicated. Place it as usual, then left click your light pole, radiator, pots and full water tank while looking at it which will equip them to the planter. Then, press E on it and where there's a square box and \"water concentration\", move the blue circle to the right until it the water concentration is 2.2. It must be 2.2 as this is proven to be the best concentration to grow weed. Then plant your 6 seeds and wait, simple. Same as above, press E to check on the planter.</p>\r\n                <p>When your plants are fully mature, click harvest ready and that will harvest your weed. You should have anywhere from 30-50 bags of weed, if you did it right. Now, with your weed in your inventory, go to the dealer, sell the weed to him and then buy more seeds, repeat. When planting new seeds on a basic planter, you need to buy a water bottle from a gas station and left click it while looking at the dry planter box. With a planter box, 1 batch of weed takes around 15 ml of water, so you'll have half a tank left.</p>\r\n                <p>Then simply repeat this process, you won't make millions but you'll make enough money for the next step!</p>\r\n                <p>I won't include details on robbing the bank in this guide, as that's more advanced and requires more experience. Also, while you're at the bazaar; buy yourself a gun!</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n        )\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default SectionFour;","import React from 'react';\r\n\r\nclass SectionFive extends React.Component {\r\n    render() {\r\n        return (\r\n            <div>\r\n                <p>Now the question you've probably been asking, how do I get a car? Well you won't be able to get a nice whip just yet, but you can most definitely afford the best car in the game - the mini cooper 1965. Every player has owned one of these and its an amazing starter car, for only $25,000, it's yours!</p>\r\n                <p>To buy this beauty of a car, go to the car dealer marked on the <a href=\"#section3\">detailed map</a>, right next to bazaar. Go upstairs and speak to the NPC on the right, ask what they have in stock and find the mini cooper under the mini section. I wouldn't recommend buying any different car at this stage, definitely not that shtity ford pickup truck. The mini maxes 35mph and it's just shit but for the price, it's good.</p>\r\n                <p>Once you've purchased your lovely new car, go to the NPC at the bottom of the stairs to rice out your car; change colour, gloss and whatever else you want. This can be expensive so be careful not to spend all your drug money. Your car will already be spawned now but to spawn it, go to the NPC out the front and spawn it. Inside the city garage next to bank, you can also spawn it at the NPC.</p>\r\n                <p> Your car also has another cool feature, if you click T while looking at it you can open the car storage. In here you can legally store weapons, drugs and whatever else. There is limited space in here but enough to store a gun and a spare magazine.</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n        )\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default SectionFive;","import React from 'react';\r\nimport { Heading } from '../titles';\r\n\r\nconst fetchApi = () => {\r\n    const url = \"https://api.perpheads.com/city/info\";\r\n    fetch(url, {\r\n        method: \"GET\",\r\n        headers: {\r\n            \"X-Auth-Token\": \"eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIxLVVqeFwvOFhtVGJRcFlOMkZSNXBoQTl4WnA2V21Wb1R0SGQ1TU1hNmlMQU92RW1cL0tcL0o4eWtOS3FRWVwvOEpGVTRiUGJoOXdDclRyVVgrenlHMTJ6QXFUSzFVQ3hGY1VROFwvcE02anhXTT0iLCJpc3MiOiJQSEFwaSIsImV4cCI6MTU4NzUwMTk5MywiaWF0IjoxNTg3NDE1NTkzLCJqdGkiOiI3Y2FjNTIyNDJhMGJkM2FiYjk2YzViNzQyYzk5YmExOSJ9.QVNEZ_aD1wYHCsQ7cqnXBoSVIodfXpkE9zQwv25Yzjc\"\r\n        }\r\n    })\r\n        .then(resp => resp.json())\r\n        .then(function (data) {\r\n            document.getElementById(\"sales_tax\").innerHTML = ` ${data.sales_tax}%`\r\n            document.getElementById(\"income_tax\").innerHTML = ` ${data.income_tax}%`\r\n            document.getElementById(\"fuel_tax\").innerHTML = ` ${data.fuel_tax}%`\r\n            if (data.mayor_name == \"\") {\r\n                document.getElementById(\"mayor\").innerHTML = `there is no mayor.`\r\n            } else {\r\n                document.getElementById(\"mayor\").innerHTML = `the mayor is ${data.mayor_name}`\r\n            }\r\n        })\r\n        .catch(function (error) {\r\n            console.log(error);\r\n        });\r\n}\r\n\r\nfetchApi()\r\n\r\nclass SectionSix extends React.Component {\r\n    render() {\r\n        return (\r\n            <div>\r\n                <p>I've been talking about taxes this whole time, so I'll talk about them finally.

The Mayor is voted by the players and to put your name for Mayor, you can enter the election at the NPC in City Hall (spawn). The Mayor has complete control of salaries, slots of jobs and taxes.

Good!</p>\r\n                <p>Crafting is very simple, especialy with the right tools. Whenever you want to craft, I recommend you go to <a rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" href={\"http://calc.tinycoding.com/\"}>this website</a> (TinyCalc), its an incredible website that helps you to craft any amount of items and show you the exact price. I would also recommend you buy a \"Book of Law\" from the medical shop opposite bank, if you then left click this in your inventory you can see all the taxes. On TinyCalc, enter in the current sales tax and you will then have a fully accurate crafting calculator.</p>\r\n                <p>In crafting baseball bats earlier, you will have a higher firearms level. The firearms level determines what weaponry you can craft, less powerful guns take less firearms and the much better, or high caliber, guns cost up to 125. On TinyCalc you can search for items and it will tell you what you need to make them and other info. Buy up the materials to craft some baseball bats then craft them in your bazaar shop and store them in your chest in the back of the shop. You can store as many items in here as you want so it's great for bats. When you are firearms level 3 you can craft pistol ammo, which is a great thing to craft. To make ammo, go to mixtures as you would, then go to the \"Ammunition\" tab and click \"Pistol Ammo\".</p>\r\n                <Heading title=\"crafting your first gun\" else=\"guns\" />\r\n                <p>When you reach level 5 firearms, you are ready to make your first gun. Search \"Walther PPK\" into TinyCalc, press the $ icon then search \"7.65x17 magazine\" and do the same. You will now have the materials on-screen for the Walther PPK and its magazine. You can now buy these materials and craft it as you would a baseball bat but instead of going to \"Melee\" or \"Ammunition\", go to \"Weaponry\" and scroll to the bottom. You will see it flashing green. Once you have crafted this gun, go to the \"Magazines\" tab and craft the \"7.65x17 magazine\", which should be flashing green. Assuming you have already crafted some pistol ammo; you need to get the pistol ammo out of your storage, in your inventory left click on the magazine to fill it with bullets. When full, with your gun equipped press left click once and then press R. Your gun will now be loaded, to lower the weapon (put it on safety) press E + Left Click. Be aware, shooting your gun in a property can warrant a ticket from the police so be careful when and where you use your weapon.</p>\r\n                <p>Great, you have a gun and you know how to load it and put it on safety; next!</p>\r\n                <Heading title=\"basic combat\" else=\"combat\" />\r\n                <p>Gunfights are some on the most fun experiences on PERPHeads, they can be high stake and exhilerating. Gunfights do not happen lightly though, as defined by rule 3.4, you must not put your life at risk; this definitely means don't just start a gunfight for gun. I imagine you also know the concept of RDM, that comes under rule 2.5 (excessive negativity). You need to have a justified reason to shoot someone or you risk being banned. For example, if someone punches you, you can't then shoot them. An example of a justified reason to shoot someone is if they attempt to raid your property with weapons, you are then fully permitted to shoot them under self defenced, justified by section 2 of the paralake penal code and the rules.</p>\r\n                <p>When in a gunfight, you should always aim for the head. Depending on which gun you're using, a body shot may not be as effective; especially if they're using a more high caliber weapon. As it stands, a Walther PPK cannot 1 tap people, though every other gun can. A 1 tap is simply when someone dies from one shot. When someone is \"dead\", they aren't fully dead. Sounds complicated but it's not; someone is still alive when they are down and moaning, they are just \"red screened\", unconscious. To properly kill (black screen) someone, you shoot them again until they stop moaning. Then they are dead.</p>\r\n                <p>When you are \"red screened\" you still have a chance of being revived, however when you're \"black screened\" you will need to wait another 4 minutes before being alive again and a further 5 minutes before interacting with the situation.</p>\r\n                <p>When you are shot, stabbed, hit with a bat too many times or fall from a height; you bleed. The only way to stop bleeding before it kills you is to use a bandage, which you can buy from the medical shop opposite bank. After having bled and bandaged yourself, you will likely be \"crippled\", this means you walk slowly and are forced to be healed by either a stim pack, medic or go to the back of hospital and pay to be healed.</p>\r\n                <p>Before going into a gunfight, I recommend getting bandages because you never know what's going to happen!</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n        )\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default SectionSeven;","import React from 'react';\r\nclass SectionEight extends React.Component {\r\n    render() {\r\n        return (\r\n            <div>\r\n                <p>In this section you will want to refer to the <a href=\"#section3\">detailed map</a>.
